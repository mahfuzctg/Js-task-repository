# Problem Solving: JavaScript Challenges

This repository contains solutions to a series of JavaScript problems, focusing on tasks like array manipulation, sorting, filtering, and function composition. Each problem aims to improve your understanding of core JavaScript concepts like array methods, object manipulation, and functional programming.

## Problem List

### 1. **Array Filtering and Mapping**

- **Description**: Create an array of objects representing people with properties like name, age, and gender. Write a function to filter out all females and then map the remaining people to an array of names. Print the final result.

### 2. **Object Manipulation**

- **Description**: Create an array of objects representing books with properties like title, author, and year. Write a function that takes the array and returns a new array with only the book titles. Print the result.

### 3. **Function Composition**

- **Description**: Write three functions: one to square a number, one to double a number, and one to add 5 to a number. Compose these functions to create a new function that squares a number, doubles the result, and then adds 5.

### 4. **Sorting Objects**

- **Description**: Create an array of objects representing cars with properties like make, model, and year. Write a function to sort the array of cars by the year of manufacture in ascending order. Print the sorted array.

### 5. **Find and Modify**

- **Description**: Write a function that searches an array of objects for a specific person by name. If found, modify their age property. Print the updated array.

### 6. **Array Reduction**

- **Description**: Create an array of numbers. Write a function that uses the reduce method to calculate the sum of all even numbers in the array.

### 7. **Leap Year Checker**

- **Description**: Write a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year. Example: Happy New Year.

### 8. **Unique Values**

- **Description**: Create an array of numbers with some duplicate values. Write a function to filter out the duplicate values and return a new array with only unique numbers. Print the result.

### 9. **Advanced Sorting**

- **Description**: Create an array of objects representing students with `name` and `grades` properties. Write a function to sort the students by average grade in descending order.

### 10. **Functional Programming - Reduce**

- **Description**: Write a function that uses the `reduce` function to calculate the total value of an array of objects with a `quantity` and `price` property.
